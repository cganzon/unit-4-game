# Crystal Collector Game

This is a game where the user is tasked with reaching a specified random number (between 19 and 120) by clicking on four crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random value between 1 and 12. However, the actual value of each crystal must be remembered, as they will not be displayed to the user after being clicked on. The user must find a way to combine the individual crystal values in order to meet the specified target number. If the user is able to match the target, the game indicates a win, and if the user goes over the target, the game indicates a loss. Once a win or loss is tallied, the crystals are each assigned a new random value and the game picks a new target number.

Note: Not all games or winnable with how the game is structured.
